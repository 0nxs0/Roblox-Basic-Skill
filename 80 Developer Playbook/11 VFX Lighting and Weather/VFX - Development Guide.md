# VFX — Development Guide

New practical guidance for [[11 VFX Lighting and Weather/VFX/VFX - Hub|VFX]]. This companion adds a build and validation plan; use the linked source for full reference detail.

## Source-grounded context
This is a Map of Content (MOC) for the Top G Vault knowledge graph. Use it to enter this subject from the graph and then follow the connected production notes.
**Useful source sections:** Notes in this cluster, Related clusters, Deep dives.

## Apply it
Use this topic as part of **keep effects readable and affordable**.
- **Define the contract:** For VFX, write down behavior, inputs, state owner, visible result, and failure response.
- **Build a first slice:** Prototype timing, color, and silhouette against the real camera with an effect budget.
- **Maintain it:** Separate tuning data from behavior, record assumptions, and provide cleanup or rollback before connecting more systems.
- **Project risk:** Pool repeated effects, cap lifetimes, preserve hazard readability, and test mobile.

## Validate before shipping
- **Expected path:** Build one small feature using VFX and record setup and expected result.
- **Boundary case:** Test missing, invalid, repeated, delayed, or interrupted input where relevant.
- **Integration:** Test with neighboring systems and at target device/player scale.
- **Acceptance check:** Check cleanup, simultaneous effects, and frame cost.
